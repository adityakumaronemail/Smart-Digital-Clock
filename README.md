# Smart-Digital-Clock
Display data on Raspberry Pi such as date, day, time, location, etc

Abstract:

We will use a raspberry pi and a sense hat module and weatherapi from weatherapi.com and show the current time as well as temperature on sense hat device by taking data from the api and filtering it and showing it on sensehat module which can be further customized as the user wants, this will achieve the goal of a multipurpose mini device which can display data.

We could use this to make additional IoT devices such as smart watch, a LED data display board and show live data from websites.
